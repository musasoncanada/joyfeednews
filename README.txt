JoyFeed — Direct Open (iframe removed)
-----------------------------------------
This update removes the reader iframe and opens all stories directly on the source site in a new tab.
It also keeps the Preview modal for a quick read.

Install:
1) Replace your existing `app.js` with this one.
2) (Optional) Delete `reader.html` from the repo.
3) Commit & push — Netlify will redeploy.

No changes needed to netlify.toml.
