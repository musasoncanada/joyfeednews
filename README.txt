# JoyFeed — Direct Open
This update removes the iframe reader and opens sources directly in a new tab. It also adds a lightweight **Preview** modal so users can skim before they click.

## Files included
- `app.js` — updated links (target=_blank) + preview modal.
- `modal.css` — CSS you can append to your existing `styles.css` (copy & paste to the end).

## How to install
1. Replace `app.js` in your repo with the one in this zip.
2. Open your existing `styles.css`, paste the contents of `modal.css` at the very bottom.
3. Commit & push.
